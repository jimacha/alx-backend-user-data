# 0x02. Session Authentication
## Back-end Authentication

## Project Description

In this project, we implement Session Authentication from scratch, understanding each step involved in creating a secure and effective authentication system. The objective is to learn the fundamentals of session management and user authentication without relying on external modules or frameworks.

## Background Context

Session Authentication is a critical aspect of web application security. While in real-world applications, it's advisable to use established modules or frameworks (such as Flask-HTTPAuth in Python-Flask) to handle authentication, this project aims to educate developers about the underlying principles.

## Project Requirements

To reinforce the learning experience, you are not allowed to use any external modules for this project. All authentication mechanisms must be implemented manually, ensuring a deep understanding of session management and user authentication processes.

## Project Guidelines

- **Session Management:** Implement a secure session management system that handles user authentication tokens, ensuring sessions are created, managed, and destroyed securely.
- **Password Hashing:** Implement password hashing techniques to store user passwords securely. Use strong cryptographic algorithms to hash passwords and store them in a secure manner.
- **Authentication Endpoints:** Create authentication endpoints to handle user login, logout, and session validation requests. Implement secure communication channels for transmitting authentication data.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling mechanisms to provide informative and secure responses to users during authentication processes.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x02-session-authentication.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd 0x02-session-authentication
   ```

## How to Run

1. Start the back-end server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
2. Access the authentication endpoints via the appropriate routes.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Express.js (optional for routing)
